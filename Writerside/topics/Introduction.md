# Introduction

In the Independent Society of Knowledge (ISK), projects serve as the essential building blocks for achieving specific objectives within the framework of broader initiatives. These projects are pivotal for advancing ISK's mission of decentralization, collaboration, and open access in academia. Each project is designed to tackle concrete goals and contribute to the overall strategy of the associated initiative, ensuring focused progress and measurable outcomes. This article introduces the concept of projects within ISK, outlining their role, scope, and significance in driving meaningful change.



## Purpose

Projects within ISK are defined by their specific objectives, limited scope, and defined timelines. Unlike initiatives, which encompass multiple projects and aim for systemic change, individual projects address targeted aspects or tasks that contribute to the initiative's goals. Each project operates with clear, achievable goals and a set timeframe, making it essential for project planning and execution. This article delves into the core purpose of projects, differentiating them from broader initiatives, and providing insight into their role in implementing concrete activities and achieving short to medium-term objectives.


##  Audience

The audience for ISK projects includes ISK members, collaborators, stakeholders, and external contributors who are involved in or impacted by the project. ISK members and collaborators are directly engaged in project activities, providing expertise, resources, and support. Stakeholders may include partners, funding bodies, and other organizations interested in the project's outcomes. This article outlines the various groups involved in or affected by ISK projects, highlighting their roles and the importance of effective communication and collaboration to ensure the success of each project.

## Goals

The goals of ISK projects are to implement specific objectives that advance the broader aims of the associated initiatives. Projects are designed to address particular tasks, solve defined problems, and contribute to the initiative's overall impact. The structured lifecycle of a project includes stages such as initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and closure, each with its own set of goals and requirements. This article outlines the key goals of ISK projects, including achieving targeted outcomes, managing resources effectively, and ensuring successful project completion and impact. Through a structured approach, ISK projects aim to drive progress, foster collaboration, and support the organization's mission of open-access knowledge and academic flexibility.
