# Brand Identity

The identity of Independent Society of Knowledge, lies within the values it holds for knowledge. Decentralization, Collaboration, and Open-Access. These values are the key to ISK's both mission, and vision. Aside from these concepts, it is important for Independent Society of Knowledge to represent itself, as a modern, new, and alternative route in academia, but be serious and not casual. 

In this section we would investigate our brand identity. Starting from The [Logo](Logo.md), and moving towards [Colors](Colors.md), and [Typography](Typography.md), as the foundational aspects of a good Brand Identity.
