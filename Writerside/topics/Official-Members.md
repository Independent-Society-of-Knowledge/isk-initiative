# Official Members

The ISK project welcomes collaboration from various contributors without necessitating formal membership. However, there are specific scenarios where official membership is advantageous and necessary. This document outlines the roles, benefits, and requirements for becoming an official member of the ISK project.


## Roles and Responsibilities
Official members of the ISK project play a pivotal role in shaping the direction and future of the initiative. Their responsibilities include:
- Voting on project directions and initiatives.

## Ranking System
Official members are ranked based on their contributions to the ISK project. The ranking system ensures that members who contribute more have a greater influence on decisions and the project's direction. Key aspects of this system include:
- Contribution-based ranking: The more a member contributes, the higher their rank.
