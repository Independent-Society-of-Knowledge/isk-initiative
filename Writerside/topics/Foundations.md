# Foundations

The Independent Society of Knowledge is a movement, through which, an alternative route to scientific inquiry is established.
It is a community driven organization that deals with problems in academia and suggesting possible solutions to it.
This can mean proposing platforms, software, researches, and communities that could bend knowledge to a more free region.

The core values of ISK are:
1. [Decentralization](Decentralization.md)
2. [Collaboration](Collaboration.md)
3. [Open-Access](Open-Access.md)
