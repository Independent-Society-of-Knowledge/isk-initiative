Welcome to the foundational document of the Independent Society of Knowledge (ISK).
This document serves as a comprehensive guide outlining the core structure, policies, initiatives, and future

The Independent Society of Knowledge is built upon the principles of decentralization, collaboration, and open-access,
striving to create an inclusive and innovative environment for scientific exploration and advancement.
Our mission is to foster a community where knowledge is freely shared, collaborative efforts are encouraged, and
scientific research is accessible to all.

## What will this document cover?

This document is structured to provide a detailed overview of ISK's foundation, guiding both new and existing members,
and outsiders through our principles, membership policies, projects, educational programs, collaboration platforms,
funding mechanisms, and future goals.
It is intended to serve as both an introduction and a roadmap for those who wish to contribute to and benefit from our
unique approach to science and knowledge dissemination.
