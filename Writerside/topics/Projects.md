# Projects

In the Independent Society of Knowledge (ISK), projects are the operational units that drive specific objectives within broader initiatives. They are fundamental to the realization of ISK's mission of promoting decentralization, collaboration, and open access in academia. Projects focus on concrete goals and are crucial for implementing the strategies of various initiatives.

## Defining Projects

### What Constitutes a Project?

- **Specific Objectives:** Projects have well-defined, achievable goals that contribute to the broader aims of an initiative.
- **Limited Scope:** Each project is narrower in scope compared to initiatives, targeting specific tasks or problems.
- **Defined Timeline:** Projects operate within a set timeframe, with clear milestones and deadlines.

### Differentiating Projects from Initiatives

- **Projects:**
    - **Targeted Goals:** Address specific aspects or tasks within an initiative.
    - **Operational Focus:** Concentrate on implementing concrete activities and achieving short to medium-term objectives.
    - **Time-bound:** Have a defined start and end date, with measurable deliverables.

- **Initiatives:**
    - **Broad Movements:** Encompass multiple projects and aim for systemic change.
    - **Comprehensive Scope:** Address wide-ranging issues and pursue long-term goals.
    - **Ongoing:** Operate continuously, integrating various projects to achieve overarching objectives.

## Lifecycle of Projects

    - **Activity Execution:** Carry out project activities according to the project plan.
    - **Monitoring:** Track progress against milestones and deliverables, ensuring adherence to the timeline and budget.

- **Communication:**
    - **Regular Updates:** Provide regular updates to stakeholders and project team members.
    - **Reporting:** Document progress, challenges, and adjustments in project reports.

### Monitoring and Evaluation

- **Performance Metrics:**
    - **Progress Tracking:** Use performance metrics to assess progress, including completion of milestones and deliverables.
    - **Impact Assessment:** Evaluate the impact of the project on achieving its objectives and contributing to the overall initiative.

- **Feedback Collection:**
    - **Stakeholder Input:** Gather feedback from stakeholders, team members, and collaborators.
    - **Continuous Improvement:** Use feedback to make necessary adjustments and improvements.

### Closure

    - **Final Deliverables:** Ensure all deliverables are completed and meet the agreed-upon standards.
    - **Documentation:** Compile final project documentation, including reports, lessons learned, and recommendations.

- **Evaluation and Reflection:**
    - **Review:** Conduct a final evaluation to assess the project’s success and impact.
    - **Reflection:** Reflect on the project’s outcomes and processes, identifying strengths and areas for improvement.

- **Handover:**
    - **Transition:** If applicable, transition ongoing activities or responsibilities to other projects or teams.
    - **Closure Report:** Prepare and distribute a project closure report summarizing key outcomes and insights.

## Proposing a Project to ISK

### Proposal Submission Process

1. **Concept Submission:**
    - **Initial Idea:** Submit a concept note outlining the project’s goals, scope, and expected outcomes.
    - **Alignment:** Ensure the project aligns with the objectives of the relevant initiative.

2. **Detailed Proposal:**
    - **Project Plan:** Develop a detailed project plan, including objectives, timeline, resource requirements, and risk assessment.
    - **Budget:** Provide a budget estimate and resource allocation plan.

3. **Review and Approval:**
    - **Review Committee:** The proposal will be reviewed by the relevant initiative’s leadership or project approval committee.
    - **Feedback:** Receive feedback and make necessary revisions to the proposal.

4. **Final Approval:**
    - **Approval Decision:** Obtain final approval from the initiative leaders or ISK executive board.
    - **Project Launch:** Upon approval, initiate the project according to the established plan.

Projects are the operational backbone of ISK’s initiatives, focusing on specific, actionable goals that drive progress and impact. By following a structured lifecycle—from initiation and planning to execution, monitoring, and closure—projects ensure the successful implementation of broader initiatives. Proposing a project involves a clear process of concept submission, detailed planning, and review, aligning with ISK’s mission to foster decentralized, collaborative, and open-access knowledge. Through effective project management, ISK can achieve meaningful change and advance its vision for a more flexible and inclusive academic environment.
