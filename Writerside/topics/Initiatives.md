# Initiatives

The Independent Society of Knowledge (ISK) is dedicated to transforming academia through flexibility, decentralization, and collaboration, while ensuring open access to knowledge and scientific inquiry for all. This overarching mission is embodied in various initiatives, each aimed at driving significant change within specific domains of science, development, or research. Unlike individual projects, which focus on specific objectives, initiatives encompass multiple projects and represent broader movements with transformative goals.

## Defining Initiatives

### What Constitutes an Initiative?

- **Scope and Scale:** Initiatives are comprehensive movements that include multiple interconnected projects. They aim for systemic change rather than isolated outcomes.
- **Core Objective:** Each initiative targets a fundamental aspect of academia, science, or development that needs transformation.
- **Long-term Vision:** Initiatives are driven by a long-term vision and commitment to sustained impact and progress.

### Differentiating Initiatives from Projects

- **Initiatives:**
    - **Broader Movements:** Address systemic issues and pursue widespread change.
    - **Multiple Projects:** Include various projects working towards a common goal.
